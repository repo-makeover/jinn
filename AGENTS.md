# Agent Execution Contract

This file is the canonical repo-wide instruction contract for coding, audit,
documentation, and maintenance agents. Model-specific files such as `CLAUDE.md`,
`GEMINI.md`, `CODEX.md`, or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` may add tool-specific
preferences, but they must not redefine, duplicate, or weaken this contract — they
should be thin pointers back to `AGENTS.md`.

## Repository Contract

Jinn is a lightweight AI gateway daemon that orchestrates professional AI coding
CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity). It is a **pnpm + Turborepo TypeScript
monorepo**. It declares `family: application`, `repo_type: service`,
`repo_profile: service_backend` in `governance/repo_config.yaml`.

- Packages: `packages/jinn` (core gateway daemon + CLI, published as `jinn-cli`)
  and `packages/web` (Vite + React dashboard served by the daemon).
- Canonical control surfaces: `AGENTS.md`, `governance/`, `schemas/`,
  `control/`, and `docs/`.
- Purpose: wrap battle-tested engine CLIs behind one daemon and add only routing,
  scheduling, connectors, and the org system — "a bus, not a brain".
- Allowed automation behavior: inspect all repo files; propose or apply scoped
  changes; update governance/compliance records when explicitly instructed.
- Prohibited automation behavior: weakening baseline agent/governance rules,
  silently widening scope, adding fake feature behavior, breaking the Claude
  subscription / interactive-PTY billing path (see README "How the Claude engine
  works"), or committing secrets / `~/.jinn` runtime state.


<!-- GILES:FEATURE-LEDGER:START -->
## Giles feature ledger requirement

Before making implementation, refactor, config, test, or documentation changes, identify the active feature or task.

For each feature-level change, append or update the repo-local Giles feature ledger under:

`.giles/feature-ledger/`

Each ledger entry must record:

- feature id
- short action summary
- touched files
- validation run
- remaining open items
- provenance

Do not claim completion unless the ledger and validation results are updated.
Do not overwrite prior ledger entries.
If reconstructing history from archive/session/audit logs, mark provenance as reconstructed or inferred.

<!-- GILES:DOCS-GOVERNANCE:START -->
## Giles Compliance

- README.md and docs/INDEX.md are required read-order surfaces for repository
  orientation.
- Mermaid diagrams must follow `docs/agent/mermaid-diagram-guidance.md`.
- Documentation patch rules: documentation must be source-grounded; no invented
  or fabricated facts, claims, or docs; verify before writing.
- Treat `.giles/*.yaml` as advisory/discovery-only until validated by a fresh
  Giles scan.
- `.giles` artifacts are local advisory sidecar outputs that may not be
  available without Giles. Canonical compliance data lives under
  `governance/logs/`, while governing repo policy lives under `governance/`,
  `docs/`, and this `AGENTS.md` contract.
- Agents record evidence and do not declare compliance. Only Giles writes or
  refreshes canonical compliance status, and agents must report residual risks,
  skipped checks, and validation failures plainly.
- Cloud/remote agents or agents without local Giles/Dory access may ignore Giles
  and Dory requirements; those requirements are waived when the tools are
  unavailable, and the agent should continue with the repo contract plus visible
  disclosure.
- orchestrator/router file contract: router files are allowed to grow in number
  of registrations, but not in domain behavior.
- Orchestrator/router file contract: orchestrator/router files may only
  register routes/commands, parse shallow adapter inputs, call domain services,
  sequence high-level workflow steps, and translate service outputs. They must
  not host business rules, persistence mutation, validation algorithms,
  lifecycle/state machines, dedup/merge/repair logic, or archive/file parsing;
  new non-routing behavior belongs in focused domain modules.

## Agent Operating Rules

- One task per run; run validation before done.
- Agents must read `AGENTS.md` first.
- Read existing code before edits; prefer minimal, focused diffs over rewrites.
- One coherent task per run; if scope expands, document and justify it.
- Run validation before declaring completion; if partial, say so with residual risks.
- Do not delete or overwrite user work; preserve existing behavior unless the task
  requires a change.
- No fake success, stubbed completion, invented APIs/imports/paths, or hidden errors.
- Do not edit out-of-scope or frozen paths (`control/**`, `governance/**`) unless the
  task explicitly requires it and authority allows.

## Documentation Rules

- Keep `docs/INDEX.md` aligned with new or renamed operator-facing docs and the
  current month's log/audit summaries.
- Keep documentation aligned with current behavior; use explicit status language
  (implemented, partially validated, residual risks). Update docs in the same change set.
- Do not claim production readiness for scaffolded surfaces without evidence.
- Public CLI/API/UI surfaces are catalogued in `docs/feature_inventory.md`; keep it current.

## Compliance

Governance posture for this repo lives under `governance/`:
- `governance/repo_config.yaml`, `governance/repo_manifest.yaml`, and
  `governance/policy.yaml` define the repo type and policy.
- Blocking findings/actions must be remediated or explicitly justified through the
  governed exception workflow (`governance/exceptions.yaml`).
- Informational findings are non-blocking unless a policy explicitly elevates them.
- Keep `family: application`, `repo_type: service`, and `repo_profile: service_backend`
  aligned with the actual repo structure.

## Validation

This monorepo's authoritative checks (run from the repo root):

```bash
pnpm typecheck   # turbo tsc --noEmit across packages
pnpm test        # turbo test (vitest in packages/web, node tests in packages/jinn)
pnpm lint        # turbo lint
pnpm build       # turbo build (also copies packages/web/out -> packages/jinn/dist/web)
```

## Operating Principles

- Prefer the smallest coherent change that satisfies the task.
- Make failure states visible; do not hide uncertainty, skipped validation, degraded
  mode, or partial completion.
- Do not bundle unrelated work.

## Core Rules

1. Inspect existing code, nearby files, tests, docs, and conventions before writing new code.
2. Do not invent APIs, imports, commands, files, configuration keys, or paths. Verify before use.
3. Preserve project style: naming, formatting, architecture, UI language, logging, tests.
4. Execute one coherent task per run. Do not bundle unrelated fixes or opportunistic cleanup.
5. Stay in scope. If a necessary change touches adjacent scope, disclose it explicitly.
6. Prefer the smallest coherent change that satisfies the task and preserves existing behavior.
7. Surface conflicting patterns instead of averaging them; choose the least risky local convention.
8. Never silently fail. Surface partial success, blocked work, degraded mode, skipped checks.
9. Do not hide or suppress errors to make tests, UI, logs, or reports look clean.
10. Run the relevant tests/checks before declaring completion. State what passed, failed, or was not run.
11. Summarize meaningful tool actions and file changes with their effect.
12. Stop at the task boundary, destructive action, or unresolved ambiguity; report state and next safe step.

## Repository State Rules

13. Do not treat uncommitted files as failure by default. Report them as repository state.
14. Severity `info` findings are not automatic failures. Fail only on configured fail conditions.
15. Respect documented exceptions. A known, governed exception is reported as covered, not rediscovered.
16. Do not modify generated artifacts, vendored files, lockfiles, or `packages/*/dist`/`out` unless required.

## Audit Rules

17. For audit tasks, write findings and evidence. Do not patch code unless explicitly instructed.
18. For patch tasks, keep changes scoped and avoid opportunistic architecture rewrites.
19. Findings must include evidence paths, observed behavior, expected behavior, and remediation guidance.
20. Do not average conflicting conventions. Report the conflict and make the smallest reversible local choice.

## Canonical filename

Use `AGENTS.md` (uppercase) as the single canonical instruction file for this repository.

<!-- audit-retention-convention -->
## Audit File Retention

Audits are written under `docs/audits/`. The entire `docs/audits/` tree is a
**git-ignored local artifact** — audit detail files and monthly summaries live only
on the machine that produced them and are not part of the published repo.

Writing a new audit: write `docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` (optionally bucket it
under `docs/audits/MMYYYY/`). Keep findings with evidence paths, observed vs.
expected behavior, and remediation guidance.
<!-- /audit-retention-convention -->

<!-- session-log-convention -->
## Session and Activity Log Retention

Human-authored session logs, activity logs, repair logs, handoff notes, and agent
run narratives belong under `docs/logs/`, not a top-level `logs/`. New session logs
should be written to `docs/logs/session/<MMYYYY>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`.

Both `docs/logs/` and the top-level `logs/` (generated runtime telemetry such as
`logs/agent-activity.jsonl`) are **git-ignored local artifacts** — they are not part
of the published repo.
