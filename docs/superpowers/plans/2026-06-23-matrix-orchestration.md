# Matrix Orchestration — End-to-End Capability Plan

> **Status:** Phase 1 and M1–M12 are **complete** (Codex, 2026-06-24);
> M12 adds the post-dashboard safe-controls slice.
> This is the **full-capability roadmap** from inert scaffold to real,
> daemon-integrated provider-neutral matrix scheduler; reading it changes no code.
>
> **Execution discipline:** Every implementation milestone below is built with the
> `plan-prototype-build` skill at `~/vscode/agent-skills/30_plan/plan-prototype-build/`
> (Gates 0–7: orient → plan → skeleton → core → interface/IO/persistence → hardening
> → docs → final QA/QC), with a per-gate audit, a defect ledger, and the 800-line
> file limit enforced via `tools/line_count_check.sh`. The *roadmap* is the milestone
> sequence M1–M10, M10.5, M11, M12; the *gate loop* is how each milestone is implemented.
>
> **Authority model (from the source brief):** one strong implementer per slice +
> strict written brief + small patch slices + deterministic tests + manual review.
> The Jinn agent "department" is a **review/hardening layer**, never the first mover.
> Do not point the whole department at "implement matrix orchestration".

## 0. Goal & Non-Goals

### Goal

A **provider-neutral matrix orchestration layer** for Jinn (extractable to Cuttlefish
later) that dynamically assembles task-specific teams from a pool of qualified
workers, while:

- preventing agent collision (exclusive leases),
- controlling cost (quota + risk-based team assembly + local-compute preference),
- using local compute aggressively (Ollama/Pi/local workers for triage),
- preserving the **one-implementer-per-patch-slice** discipline (isolated worktrees),
- keeping **deterministic tests/validation as authority**, not model confidence.

The target shape: `central scheduler + persistent worker pool + ephemeral coordinators
+ exclusive leases + queue/blocking + provider-aware routing + isolated worktrees +
deterministic QA gates`.

### Non-Goals (whole program)

- Permanent "OpenAI department vs Anthropic department" topology.
- DAWES-specific governance (SAM.gov, GSA, SBIR, provenance gates) baked into the
  generic scheduler — those are downstream policy packs, later, elsewhere.
- Breaking the Claude **subscription / interactive-PTY billing path**
  (`cc_entrypoint=cli`) — see `AGENTS.md` "Prohibited automation behavior".
- Replacing the existing session execution engine. The scheduler sits **above**
  the session manager; it does not reimplement engine execution.

### Non-Goals (Phase 1, already honored by Codex)

No real provider calls, no GUI, no daemon integration, no worktrees, no persistence,
no changes to the live `~/.jinn` runtime or port 7777. (Verified: `packages/jinn/src/
orchestration/*` is in-memory and pure.)

---

## 1. Orientation (Gate 0 output — repo facts that constrain the design)

This section is the load-bearing part of the plan: the design is shaped by what
**already exists**. File:line references are exact as of 2026-06-23.

### 1.1 Repo shape

- pnpm + Turborepo TS monorepo. Packages: `packages/jinn` (gateway daemon + CLI,
  published as `jinn-cli`) and `packages/web` (Vite/React dashboard).
- Validation (repo root): `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint` (turbo reports
  *no lint tasks configured* today), `pnpm build`. Per-package vitest:
  `pnpm --filter jinn-cli test -- <glob>` or `cd packages/jinn && npx vitest run <file>`.
- Node `>=24 <25`. ESM with `.js` import suffixes (mandatory).
- Governance: `governance/repo_config.yaml` declares `family: application`,
  `repo_type: service`, `repo_profile: service_backend`. `control/` and `governance/`
  currently contain **no enforced YAML policy files** in this checkout; `.giles/` is
  **absent**. Active constraints today = `AGENTS.md` + Dory + docs/logs + tests.
- **Software-delivery routing (`AGENTS.md`):** source edits under `~/vscode/*` must
  route through **Giles Watcher** first (a Job Plan: scope, files to inspect, files
  allowed/forbidden to change, tests required, budget ceiling, escalation criteria,
  expected report fields) *before any implementer is spawned*. The operator may waive
  per session. **Each implementation milestone below requires a Giles Job Plan or an
  explicit waiver as a gate precondition.**

### 1.2 Engine layer (the substrate the ProviderAdapter must wrap, not replace)

- Common interface: `Engine { name; run(opts): Promise<EngineResult> }` at
  `packages/jinn/src/shared/types.ts:14`. Stateful engines add
  `InterruptibleEngine { kill, isAlive, killAll, killIdle }` (same file).
- `EngineRunOpts` carries `prompt, systemPrompt, sessionId, resumeSessionId, cwd,
  model, effortLevel, attachments, cliFlags, mcpConfigPath, onStream, onActivity`.
  `EngineResult` carries `{ sessionId, result, cost?, durationMs?, numTurns?,
  contextTokens?, error?, rateLimit? }`. Streaming via `onStream(delta: StreamDelta)`.
- Engine registry is a `Map<string, Engine>` built in `packages/jinn/src/gateway/
  server.ts:365`. Names: `claude, codex, antigravity, grok, pi, kiro, hermes, mock`.
- Execution models differ per engine: **interactive PTY** (claude — subscription via
  `SsePtyProxy`; antigravity PTY-only), **headless spawn + JSON/transcript tail**
  (codex, grok, pi), **ACP/JSON-RPC** (hermes — see `engines/hermes-acp.ts`),
  **credit** (kiro), **mock** (`engines/mock.ts`, zero-cost canned responses).
- **`mock` is the natural `stub_provider` / `local_echo_provider`** for orchestration
  tests — no binary, deterministic, fires `onStream`, fixed $0.001 cost.
- Model metadata: `ModelInfo { id, label, supportsEffort, effortLevels, contextWindow }`
  and `EngineRegistryEntry { name, available, defaultModel, effortMechanism, models }`
  (`shared/types.ts:559+`, built in `shared/models.ts`). There is **no** existing
  `capability`, `tools-permission`, `cost_class`, or `worker` concept on engines —
  these are new in the orchestration layer.
- Cost classes today are **implicit** per engine (subscription / api-per-call /
  credit / free). Worker `costClass` must be authored, not derived, initially.

### 1.3 Session lifecycle & concurrency (the axis the scheduler sits above)

- A `Session` (`shared/types.ts:214`) is persisted in **SQLite** at
  `~/.jinn/sessions/registry.db` (WAL mode) via `sessions/registry.ts` (`initDb()`,
  CRUD, FTS5 messages, `queue_items`, `queue_pauses` tables).
- **The only concurrency control today is per-session-key serialization**:
  `SessionQueue` (`sessions/queue.ts`) — one turn at a time *per sessionKey*, with
  pause/resume (used by rate-limit handling). There is **no global per-engine
  concurrency cap** and **no worker pool**.
- Spawn path: connector/API → `SessionManager.route()` (`sessions/manager.ts:154`)
  → `queue.enqueue(sessionKey, () => runSession(...))` → engine resolve → context
  build (`sessions/context.ts`) → MCP resolve → `engine.run(...)` → rate-limit handling
  → persist. The web/cron/talk single-turn path is `gateway/run-web-session.ts:70`.
- **No git worktree usage exists anywhere.** Sessions isolate only by `cwd` (defaults
  to `JINN_HOME`). `sessions/fork.ts` duplicates *engine session state* (Claude
  `--fork-session`, Codex JSONL copy) — it is **not** filesystem isolation. Worktrees
  (M6) are genuinely new infrastructure.
- Rate-limit / usage: `shared/rateLimit.ts` (detect), `sessions/rate-limit-handler.ts`
  (wait-and-retry or fallback-engine state machine), `shared/usage-status.ts` +
  `shared/engine-limits.ts` (per-engine reset clocks in `~/.jinn/tmp/usage|engine-limits`).
  Kiro credit ledger lives here too.
- Cron scheduler precedent: `cron/scheduler.ts` uses node-cron + an `inFlight` Set
  (one run per job; second trigger → `skipped_overlap`), runs logged append-only to
  `~/.jinn/cron/runs/<jobId>.jsonl`. This is a useful *pattern* but not a resource
  scheduler (no quota/lease/queue).

### 1.4 Gateway / org / board (the parallel coordination system — collision risk)

- HTTP server: raw `http.createServer` in `gateway/server.ts:924`; routes are a long
  if-chain in `gateway/api.ts` using `matchRoute(pattern, pathname)`
  (`gateway/api/match-route.ts`). Auth: bearer/header/cookie token, constant-time
  compare (`gateway/auth.ts`). New routes go under a new prefix (recommend
  `/api/orchestration/...`).
- **Org system** (`gateway/org.ts`, `org-hierarchy.ts`): `~/.jinn/org/<dept>/*.yaml`.
  `Employee { name(immutable), rank: executive|manager|senior|employee, engine,
  model, persona, reportsTo, maxCostUsd, mcp, modelPolicy, provides[] }`. This is a
  **standing** team with a manager hierarchy.
- **Kanban board** (`gateway/board-service.ts`, `board-sync.ts`, `board-worker.ts`):
  `~/.jinn/org/<dept>/board.json` (statuses backlog|todo|in_progress|review|done|
  blocked). The board is a **status mirror**, *not* a dispatcher — except
  `board-worker.ts`, which **auto-dispatches** `todo` tickets to the department
  **manager** every ~5 min when chat is idle and the manager's engine has quota.
- Ticket dispatch: `gateway/ticket-dispatch.ts:105` `dispatchTicket()` → creates/reuses
  a session and runs a turn via `dispatchWebSessionRun`.
- **Collision risk (Risk R1, see §10):** `board-worker` and a future scheduler are
  *two dispatchers* that could both task the same engine/employee. The matrix layer
  must become the **single allocator**; org→worker bridging is a later, explicit
  adapter (M9), and `board-worker` must defer to the scheduler when both are live.
- Telemetry today: hash-chained integrity ledger `~/.jinn/audit.jsonl`
  (`shared/audit-log.ts` `appendAudit`/`verifyAuditChain`), gateway log
  `~/.jinn/logs/gateway.log` (`shared/logger.ts`), cron run jsonl. `logs/` and
  `docs/logs/` are git-ignored local artifacts (`AGENTS.md`).

### 1.5 Paths & conventions

- All runtime state under `JINN_HOME` (`shared/paths.ts`): `sessions/registry.db`,
  `cron/`, `org/`, `audit.jsonl`, `logs/`, `tmp/`, etc. **Never commit `~/.jinn`.**
- Plans live in `docs/superpowers/plans/<date>-<slug>.md`; design specs in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/<date>-<slug>-design.md`. `docs/INDEX.md` already indexes
  the `docs/superpowers/plans/` directory, so this file needs no INDEX edit.
- Public CLI/API/UI surfaces are catalogued in `docs/feature_inventory.md` (update
  per milestone as surfaces land — Codex already added the Phase-1 CLI rows).

---

## 2. Current state (what Phase 1 delivered)

Codex implemented the inert foundation (verified by reading the files):

- `packages/jinn/src/orchestration/{types,schemas,config,scheduler,index}.ts` — pure,
  in-memory, deterministic `MatrixScheduler` (atomic required-role allocation,
  optional-role best-effort, capability/tool/family/quota/concurrency matching,
  opposite-family reviewer constraint, deterministic worker sort, lease lifecycle:
  create/heartbeat/release/expire + `validateLeaseForWorker`, blocked-resource queue
  with priority retry, telemetry event list). `scheduler.ts` = 415 lines.
- Zod schemas + YAML loaders (`schemas.ts`, `config.ts`) for
  `workers.yaml / roles.yaml / coordinators.yaml / quotas.yaml`, allocation-request
  files, and simulation-scenario files.
- CLI (`cli/orchestration.ts` + `bin/jinn.ts`): `jinn workers list`,
  `jinn scheduler allocate <task> --dry-run`, `jinn scheduler simulate <scenario>`,
  all requiring explicit `--config-dir`; `allocate` refuses to run without `--dry-run`.
- Tests: `orchestration/__tests__/scheduler.test.ts` (14 cases) +
  `cli/__tests__/orchestration-scheduler.test.ts`.
- Docs: `docs/orchestration/README.md` + `docs/orchestration/examples/*.yaml`;
  `docs/INDEX.md`; `docs/feature_inventory.md` updated; local session log under
  `docs/logs/session/062026/`.

**What is still inert / missing (the gap this plan closes):** durable state, real
provider execution, worktrees, daemon/dashboard integration, live cross-family
enforcement, dual-lane mode, durable telemetry, org→worker bridging, and the safety
glue that connects scheduler routing to real usage/quota signals.

---

## 3. Target architecture (explicit design rulings)

These are the load-bearing decisions. Each is a *ruling* the milestones implement;
each carries the risk it mitigates.

### D1 — The scheduler sits **above** the session manager (not beside it)

A **Worker is not a Session.** A worker is a capability slot = `engine + model +
tool/mcp permissions + workspace policy + concurrency limit + capability metadata`.
A **lease** authorizes one coordinator to task one worker for one role on one task.
The *actual turn execution* still flows through the existing path
(`run-web-session.ts` / `sessions/manager.ts` → `engine.run`). The scheduler grants a
lease → a coordinator builds an `EngineRunOpts` for the leased worker → the turn runs
through the normal session machinery → on completion the lease is released. This keeps
`SessionQueue` (per-session ordering) and the lease model (global worker exclusivity)
on *different axes* and avoids reimplementing execution. **Mitigates R2.**

### D2 — `ProviderAdapter` is a **thin wrapper over the existing `Engine`**

The brief's `ProviderAdapter` (`can_execute, estimate_cost, estimate_context,
start_task, stream_output, cancel, get_status, collect_artifacts`) maps onto existing
primitives — it must not duplicate them:

| ProviderAdapter method | Backed by |
|---|---|
| `can_execute(role, task, tools)` | worker capability/tool match (scheduler) + `engineAvailable()` (`shared/models.ts`) |
| `estimate_cost / estimate_context` | `EngineRegistryEntry`/`ModelInfo.contextWindow` + worker `costClass`; no live call |
| `start_task(task, lease)` | validate lease (`validateLeaseForWorker`) → `engine.run(EngineRunOpts)` |
| `stream_output(run_id)` | existing `onStream(StreamDelta)` callback / PTY stream |
| `cancel(run_id)` | `InterruptibleEngine.kill(sessionId)` |
| `get_status(run_id)` | session status (`registry.ts`) + lease state |
| `collect_artifacts(run_id)` | `EngineResult` + worktree diff (M6) + emitted files (`UPLOADS_DIR`) |

Initial adapters = `stub` (no-op), `local_echo` (= `mock` engine), `manual`
(human-in-the-loop). Real adapters reuse the registered engines. **An adapter MUST
reject any `start_task` without a valid running lease owned by the caller.**
**Mitigates R3 (collision) and R7 (provider leakage into scheduler core).**

### D3 — Durable state in SQLite, following the `registry.ts` pattern

Full capability requires surviving daemon restarts. Add orchestration tables
(`workers_runtime`?, `leases`, `allocations`, `queue_items`, `telemetry_events`) — to
a dedicated `~/.jinn/orchestration/registry.db` (cleanest extraction boundary for
Cuttlefish) **or** new tables in the existing `sessions/registry.db`. **Ruling:**
separate DB file `~/.jinn/orchestration.db`, WAL mode, same `better-sqlite3` +
migration discipline as `sessions/registry.ts`. The in-memory `MatrixScheduler` stays
the pure decision core; a thin persistence layer hydrates it on boot and writes
through on lease/queue mutations. **Mitigates R5 (state loss) while keeping the core
testable.** Config (`workers/roles/coordinators/quotas`) stays in YAML under
`~/.jinn/orchestration/*.yaml` (mirrors `org/`).

### D4 — Routing consults **real** usage/quota signals

Scheduler `QuotaPolicy` (provider/family *active-lease* caps) is concurrency, not rate
limits. Routing must *also* avoid workers whose engine is rate-limited/exhausted, by
reading the existing `shared/usage-status.ts` / `engine-limits.ts` signals (the same
`minRemainingPercent` gate `board-worker.ts` already uses). Add a routing predicate
`engineHasHeadroom(worker, config)` used during candidate filtering in live mode (off
in pure simulation). **Mitigates R8 and avoids dispatching into a wall.**

### D5 — Worktrees are task/lane-scoped, git-only, and reaped

When an implementation worker's `workspacePolicy === "isolated_worktree"` **and** the
resolved task base `cwd` is inside a git repo: create
`git worktree add <root>/jinn-<taskId>-<lane>` on a fresh branch; pass that path as the
implementation turn `cwd`. Reviewer roles consume a diff-only review bundle generated
from the implementation lane (`patch.diff` plus metadata, outside the implementation
tree), never a separate mutable reviewer worktree unless a later repair role explicitly
grants it.
Worker leases still release promptly, but the implementation worktree survives until
the task/lane lifecycle is complete so the reviewer can inspect the actual patch. Task
completion performs cleanup, and orphan cleanup plugs into the existing
`OrchestrationRuntime` boot+timer reaper. Non-git `cwd` falls back to the current
single-`cwd` behavior with a logged downgrade.
**Mitigates R-worktree (disk/orphans) and preserves one-implementer-per-slice.**

### D6 — The matrix layer is the **single allocator**; org is bridged, not merged

Keep `Employee/Manager/Department` (org) and `Worker/Coordinator/ProviderLane`
(orchestration) as separate vocabularies and separate code. Bridging is an explicit,
optional `OrgWorkerAdapter` (M9) that *reads* org employees and synthesizes workers —
it never writes org YAML. When both the scheduler and `board-worker` are enabled, the
scheduler is authoritative: `board-worker` either routes through the scheduler or is
gated off (config flag). **Mitigates R1 (two dispatchers) and R-naming.**

### D7 — Subscription / interactive-PTY billing path is sacrosanct

Any worker bound to `claude` must run through the **interactive PTY** path
(`cc_entrypoint=cli`, `SsePtyProxy`), never forced into a headless API call by the
scheduler. The adapter passes through to the existing claude engine unchanged. A
contract test asserts the scheduler never sets a flag that bypasses the PTY path.
**Mitigates the `AGENTS.md` prohibited behavior (billing-path breakage).**

### D8 — Determinism is preserved; real-provider tests are opt-in smoke only

The scheduler core stays deterministic (sorted workers, injected `now()`). All unit
tests use a fake clock + `mock`/stub workers. Real-provider execution is exercised only
by an **opt-in smoke script** (`scripts/orchestration-smoke.mjs`, mirroring
`scripts/hermes-acp-smoke.mjs`) gated behind an env flag, never in CI. **Mitigates R1
(building too much before simulation) and flaky CI.**

---

## 4. Terminology & the org reconciliation table

Code/orchestration-doc vocabulary is fixed (already enforced in
`docs/orchestration/README.md`). The org bridge maps — it does not rename:

| Org (existing, keep) | Orchestration (code) | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Employee | Worker | OrgWorkerAdapter *synthesizes* a Worker from an Employee (engine+model+mcp+maxCostUsd); read-only |
| Manager (rank) | Coordinator | A manager *kind* of task can spawn a Coordinator; not the same object |
| Department (dir) | ProviderLane | Lane = provider/local family, **not** an org department |
| Team | Allocation | — |
| Tasking | Lease | — |
| Reports-to | Lease ownership | — |

Forbidden in `packages/jinn/src/orchestration/**`: `Employee`, `Manager`,
`Department`, `Boss`, `Reportee`.

---

## 5. Milestone roadmap (M1–M11 plus M10.5 hardening interlock)

Each milestone is one `plan-prototype-build` run (Gates 0–7, §8) by **one implementer**,
preceded by a Giles Job Plan/waiver, followed by the designated review. Milestones are
mostly sequential; parallelizable pairs are noted. Phase numbers in parentheses map to
the source brief.

> Legend — **Exit gate** = the checklist that must be green to call the milestone done;
> **Team** = who does it (single implementer unless noted) and who reviews.

### M1 — Durable scheduler state (complete, 2026-06-23) ✦ foundation for everything live

- **Phase:** new (precedes brief Phase 4). **Goal:** persist leases/allocations/queue/
  telemetry so the scheduler survives daemon restarts, without changing the pure core.
- **Delivered:** `orchestration/store.ts` (better-sqlite3, WAL, dedicated
  `~/.jinn/orchestration.db`, corrupt DB recovery); `orchestration/persistent-scheduler.ts`
  (hydrates `MatrixScheduler`, write-through snapshot persistence, deterministic
  lease expiry on hydrate); schema for leases, allocations, allocation leases, queue
  items, telemetry events, and metadata; default config loader for
  `~/.jinn/orchestration/*.yaml`.
- **Integration points:** mirror `sessions/registry.ts:176` init pattern; new
  `ORCH_DB = JINN_HOME/orchestration.db` in `shared/paths.ts`.
- **Exit gate:** passed for simulated restart round-trip, corrupt/empty DB recovery,
  unchanged pure `MatrixScheduler` behavior, temp-DB-only tests, transaction rollback,
  restart-resume queued task, and expired-lease purge on hydrate.
- **Remaining boundary:** M1 is still not wired into gateway startup, live session
  execution, API routes, or CLI persistence. Those remain later milestones.
- **Team:** implementer; **review:** department adversarial pass on persistence + crash
  semantics (this is the first place the department is genuinely useful).

### M2 — Provider adapter contract (complete, 2026-06-23) ✦ highest blast radius

- **Goal:** define the provider-neutral `ProviderAdapter` interface (D2) and
  stub/echo/manual adapters; scheduler core stays ignorant of engine APIs.
- **Delivered:** `orchestration/adapter/{types,stub-adapter,local-echo-adapter,
  manual-adapter,registry}.ts`; injected lease validation; structured errors;
  fail-closed registry; `local_echo`/`mock` delegate only to `engines/mock.ts`.
- **Exit gate:** passed for valid-owned-lease rejection, structured errors, fail-closed
  lookup, scheduler import boundary, and adapter store/persistence boundary.
- **Team:** **architecture-manager mode** (architect → implementer → independent
  reviewer → adversarial reviewer → QA) — bad abstraction here poisons everything.
- **M1 carry-forward:** injected lease validation works with `MatrixScheduler` or
  `PersistentMatrixScheduler`; adapters stay store-ignorant. **Implemented.**

### M3 — Real adapter wiring + `engineHasHeadroom` routing (complete, 2026-06-23)

- **Goal:** back real workers with the registered engines (claude/codex/grok/hermes/
  pi/kiro), preserving D7; add usage-aware routing (D4).
- **Delivered:** `orchestration/adapter/real-adapter.ts` (worker.provider/model →
  existing engine via an injected engine `Map`); `orchestration/routing-headroom.ts`
  (usage-status based predicate/filter); explicit live registry factory; bounded
  adapter run retention; push-stream subscription; live cancel mapped to
  `InterruptibleEngine.kill(sessionId)`.
- **Exit gate:** passed for injected-engine Claude contract (`server.ts` still maps
  `claude` to `interactiveClaudeEngine`), headless-bypass rejection, scheduler import
  boundary, adapter store/persistence boundary, real-adapter no-concrete-engine-import
  boundary, usage-headroom filtering, and simulation staying untouched.
- **Team:** implementer; **review:** department — focus on billing-path + usage glue.
- **M2 carry-forward (resolve in M3):** (1) **`cancel(runId)` must map to the live engine
  session** — capture `ProviderRun.engineSessionId` at `startTask` (from
  `EngineRunOpts.sessionId`, known before the turn completes), not only on completion, so
  `cancel` can call `InterruptibleEngine.kill(sessionId)` to interrupt a real in-flight
  turn (without this, cancel can't stop a running engine — a real failsafe gap). (2)
  **Reconcile push vs pull streaming** — M2's `streamOutput(runId)` is vestigial (echo
  streams via the `onStream` in `EngineRunOpts`); for real engines + the M11 dashboard,
  make `streamOutput` register a subscriber against the live stream/PTY tee rather than
  return `unsupported`. (3) Bound the adapter's `runs` map (same retention note as M1).
  **Implemented.**
- **Remaining boundary:** M3 does not wire live matrix execution into sessions, daemon
  boot, API routes, CLI commands, worktrees, or dashboard controls. Those remain M4/M5+.

### M4 — Coordinator templates → live allocation API (complete, 2026-06-23)

- **Goal:** turn a task brief + coordinator template into an allocation plan the daemon
  can observe later; add read/observe HTTP + CLI surfaces.
- **Delivered:** `orchestration/coordinator.ts` (template → `AllocationRequest`,
  `matrix`, `single_worker`, and `single_worker_with_review` planning modes);
  observe-only HTTP routes under `/api/orchestration/` (`workers`, `leases`, `queue`,
  `allocations`) registered through `gateway/api.ts`; CLI `jinn leases list`,
  `jinn queue list`, and `jinn scheduler plan <task>`.
- **Validation:** focused M4 tests cover planner modes, CLI plan/list behavior, and
  GET-only API observation. Node 24 full-suite preflight was made green with
  timeout-only harness fixes for concurrent-load-sensitive tests.
- **Remaining boundary:** M4 does not wire live matrix execution into sessions,
  daemon boot, provider adapters, worktrees, dashboard controls, retry/release
  mutation routes, or board-worker dispatch. Those remain M5+.

### M5 — First real mode: `single_worker` + `single_worker_with_review` (complete, 2026-06-23)

- **Goal:** end-to-end orchestration for **low-risk tasks only**: allocate → run turn
  through the session path → release → (optional) opposite-family reviewer reads diff →
  QA → emit telemetry.
- **Delivered:** `orchestration/run-mode.ts` allocates on the daemon-owned runtime
  scheduler, creates normal Jinn sessions with lease metadata in `transportMeta`, dispatches
  through `runWebSession`, and releases each lease in `finally`. `run-web-session.ts`
  renews leases from the existing 5s `runHeartbeat` interval. `orchestration/runtime.ts`
  owns one `PersistentMatrixScheduler`, expiry/retry timer, and shutdown `close()`.
  `orchestration.enabled` is accepted in config and defaults off when absent. M4 observe
  routes read the shared runtime when present, with the old open-per-request path kept only
  as no-daemon/test fallback. `jinn run --mode single_worker|single_worker_with_review
  --task <file>` posts to `POST /api/orchestration/run`.
- **Resolved live preconditions:** persistent scheduler mutations now use incremental
  upserts/deletes instead of delete-all snapshot replacement; corrupt store recovery
  quarantines the DB and surfaces recovery telemetry; heartbeat renews `leaseExpiresAt`
  with the lease's original duration; release/expiry trigger queued-work retry.
- **Validation:** focused M5 tests cover five low-risk mock runs, review-mode sequencing,
  heartbeat renewal, persistent scheduler/store regressions, shared-runtime observe routes,
  and CLI gateway posting. `pnpm --filter jinn-cli typecheck` passed.
- **Remaining boundary:** M5 has no worktrees, dashboard controls, board-worker routing,
  dual-lane competition, org-worker bridge, persistent telemetry JSONL, or broad live-provider
  smoke. `single_worker_with_review` runs sequential sessions and prompts the reviewer as
  review-only, but read-only worktree enforcement is M6.
- **M5 carry-forward → resolved in M6:** `runOrchestrationTask` previously passed the same
  optional task `cwd` to every lease turn and released each lease independently. M6 added
  per-task lane→worktree state so the reviewer targets a diff-only bundle generated from
  the implementation lane, and the implementation worktree is cleaned up at task/lane end
  rather than on implementer lease release. It resolves the effective base `cwd` before
  git detection because task `cwd` is optional, and narrows accepted `workspacePolicy`
  values to `shared`, `read_only`, and `isolated_worktree`.

### M6 — Worktree execution (complete, 2026-06-23)

- **Goal:** isolated implementation worktrees plus diff-only reviewer access per D5.
- **Delivered:** `orchestration/worktree.ts` creates/diffs/cleans/reaps managed git
  worktrees with a marker file, git-only downgrade, path safety, and `maxWorktrees`.
  `run-mode.ts` resolves the effective base `cwd`, keeps per-task lane→worktree state,
  sends reviewers a generated diff bundle instead of the implementation worktree, releases leases
  promptly, and cleans task worktrees at task end. `OrchestrationRuntime` reuses its
  existing boot+timer reaper to remove abandoned managed worktrees whose task no longer
  has a running lease. `jinn worktree create|diff|cleanup <task> [--lane <name>]` exposes
  focused operator helpers.
- **Validation:** focused tests cover create/diff/cleanup, non-git downgrade, max
  worktree enforcement, runtime reaping, reviewer diff-bundle routing, and CLI
  worktree helpers.
- **Remaining boundary:** integration worktrees, durable patch artifacts,
  dashboard controls, and board-worker routing remain later milestones.

### M7 — Cross-family review policy in live runs (complete, 2026-06-23)

- **Goal:** enforce model-family diversity for reviewers at runtime (the scheduler core
  already supports `opposite_of_implementer`; this makes it a live, explainable policy).
- **Delivered:** `orchestration/cross-family.ts` resolves fail-closed reviewer policy,
  role-metadata reviewer detection, and explanation records. `MatrixScheduler`
  now emits reviewer-policy explanations for selected, blocked, and explicit
  same-family fallback decisions. `orchestration.sameFamilyReviewerFallback`
  permits same-family fallback only after no qualified opposite-family reviewer
  is available; opposite-family candidates still win when present.
- **Exit gate:** passed for reviewer-selection explainability, blocked-reviewer
  allocation explainability, same-family fallback permit/forbid behavior, and no
  silent downgrade in CLI/API JSON/text output.
- **Team:** implementer; **review:** department policy critique.

### M8 — Dual-lane competition (brief Phase 8) (complete, 2026-06-24)

- **Goal:** OpenAI lane and Anthropic lane produce competing patches in **isolated**
  worktrees from an identical brief; a comparison reviewer reports differences; a human
  or authorized coordinator selects the integration; the loser is archived.
- **Delivered:** `orchestration/dual-lane.ts` plus `dual-lane-state.ts`; atomic
  two-lane allocation using `openaiRole`/`anthropicRole` task fields (defaults
  `openaiImplementer`/`anthropicImplementer`); identical prompt dispatch into
  separate managed git worktrees; deterministic comparison report; persisted
  selection manifest; explicit `POST /api/orchestration/dual-lane/select` and
  `jinn dual-lane select --task-id <id> --winner openai|anthropic`; loser diff
  archived and loser worktree removed on selection.
- **Exit gate:** passed for identical prompt to both lanes, isolated worktrees,
  comparison report identifying lane-unique files, explicit selection, loser
  archive/discard, blocked dual-lane continuation persistence, and runtime
  reaper protection for pending/selected dual-lane worktrees.
- **Remaining boundary:** M8 does **not** apply the winning patch to the base
  repo or run an AI comparison reviewer turn; those remain later/operator
  workflow concerns. Durable selection telemetry is now owned by M10.
- **Team:** implementer; **review:** department integration review recommended.

### M9 — Org→Worker bridge + board-worker reconciliation (brief Phase 3) (complete, 2026-06-24)

- **Goal:** optionally synthesize workers from `~/.jinn/org/*` employees (D6); make the
  scheduler the single allocator; gate/route `board-worker` through it.
- **Delivered:** gateway-side `org-worker-bridge.ts` reads `scanOrg()` output and
  synthesizes deterministic in-memory scheduler workers/roles with exact-match
  board-dispatch capabilities; no org YAML or orchestration YAML is written. Gateway
  runtime construction augments loaded orchestration config with the synthesized
  workers when `orchestration.enabled === true`, including startup/config reload/org
  reload wiring and active-work deferred refresh. `MatrixScheduler`/runtime now expose
  immediate no-queue allocation for board tickets. `ticket-dispatch.ts` uses scheduler
  leases for manual and board-worker dispatch when orchestration is enabled, preserves
  board/session metadata and legacy behavior when disabled, attaches lease metadata for
  heartbeat renewal, releases on setup failure and after `dispatchWebSessionRun()` settles,
  and returns scheduler-specific failure reasons. Manual dispatch maps scheduler-specific
  failures to HTTP `409`.
- **Exit gate:** passed for org bridge synthesis, no durable queue item on immediate
  no-capacity allocation, release waking normal queued orchestration work, lease metadata
  and release ownership around manual dispatch, board-write failure cleanup/idempotency,
  exact-worker busy skip leaving the ticket `todo`, fail-visible no-runtime behavior, API
  `409` mapping, and unchanged legacy direct path when orchestration is disabled.
- **Remaining boundary:** M9 does not add a new dashboard control or automatic
  patch integration. Durable board-dispatch telemetry is now owned by M10.
- **Team:** implementer; **review:** department — collision + regression focus.

### M10 — Durable telemetry & empirical routing (brief Phase 9) (complete, 2026-06-24)

- **Goal:** every orchestration run emits a telemetry record; routing can prefer
  historically successful workers; failures degrade a capability score.
- **Delivered:** `orchestration/telemetry.ts` appends
  `~/.jinn/logs/orchestration-telemetry.jsonl` with the brief's fields plus nullable
  source/session/lease/context fields, validates/sanitizes records, skips corrupt JSONL
  lines with a visible count, summarizes by provider/family/role/worker/disposition,
  and computes deterministic worker scores. `run-mode.ts`, `dual-lane.ts`, and
  `ticket-dispatch.ts` emit records for scheduler-owned live turns, dual-lane
  selected/discarded outcomes, and M9 manual/board dispatch. `jinn scheduler stats
  [--path <file>] [--json]` exposes summaries. `orchestration.empiricalRouting: true`
  reads telemetry at runtime boot and uses scores only as a tie-break after hard
  constraints and explicit tier/cost preferences.
- **Exit gate:** passed for append-only private JSONL, corrupt-line-tolerant reads,
  provider/family/role/worker summaries, success/failure scoring, no prompt/raw-diff/path
  leakage, single-worker/review/worktree/dual-lane/board emission, empirical routing
  disabled-by-default behavior, score tie-breaks without overriding hard constraints or
  cost preference, corrupt telemetry startup tolerance, stats CLI JSON/text output, and
  focused typecheck.
- **Remaining boundary:** M10 deliberately skips optional hash-chained `audit.jsonl`
  integration; JSONL is the durable telemetry surface for this milestone. Dashboard
  controls remain M11. The post-M10 static audit
  `docs/audits/2026-06-24-matrix-orchestration-m1-m10-audit.md` found lifecycle
  hardening work that is now a blocking M10.5 interlock before M11.
- **Team:** implementer; can use a **local-heavy (Pi/Ollama) worker** for log triage.

### M10.5 — Lifecycle hardening and zero-known-defect gate (blocking before M11)

- **Goal:** close the known M1–M10 timing/path/connectivity/concurrency defects before
  building dashboard controls or presenting orchestration as operator-safe. Source
  audit: `docs/audits/2026-06-24-matrix-orchestration-m1-m10-audit.md`.
- **Delivered:** active config/org reload keeps the current runtime bound and records a
  deferred refresh until drain; gateway shutdown now prepares the runtime before close
  by stopping new resumes, marking dispatching continuations failed, and releasing
  running leases; stale `dispatching` live continuations are recovered on boot; live
  `single_worker`, review, queued resume, and dual-lane allocation apply engine
  headroom before creating leases; pre-dispatch setup failures release still-running
  leases; empirical-routing startup reads a bounded telemetry tail and hot-path
  telemetry appends avoid per-record fsync stalls.
- **Deliverables:**
  1. **Runtime lifecycle safety:** config reload must not replace/close an active
     orchestration runtime; graceful shutdown must stop new dispatch, settle/interrupt
     active runs, release/expire owned leases, mark in-flight continuations recoverable,
     then close the runtime. Close must account for fire-and-forget queued-resume
     promises.
  2. **Lease-release invariant:** every allocated lease has a deterministic terminal
     owner on pre-dispatch failures, including invalid lease validation, missing engine,
     `createSession()`, `insertMessage()`, and `updateSession()` failures. Failed launch
     paths must release the lease and emit visible failure/telemetry where possible.
  3. **Continuation recovery:** stale `dispatching` live continuations from a prior
     daemon process must become retryable or failed on boot after a bounded threshold,
     without keeping `hasActiveWork()` true forever.
  4. **Live headroom before leasing:** live orchestration allocation must apply
     engine-availability/usage headroom before creating leases, while preserving pure
     simulation determinism and scheduler hard constraints.
  5. **Deferred org refresh replay:** an org-worker refresh deferred for active work must
     be remembered and applied automatically after drain; stale synthesized workers must
     not survive indefinitely after the blocking run finishes.
  6. **Bound telemetry IO:** empirical routing must not synchronously read unbounded
     historical JSONL on every runtime boot/config reload, and run telemetry append must
     avoid unbounded event-loop stalls while preserving private append-only records.
- **Findings closed:** `FSR-MATRIX-001`, `FSR-MATRIX-002`, `FSR-MATRIX-003`,
  `RRR-MATRIX-004`, `ONR-MATRIX-005`, `ONR-MATRIX-006`, `FSR-MATRIX-007`.
- **Exit gate:** all seven audit findings are `fixed` or `verified-not-a-defect` with
  deterministic tests; `pnpm --filter jinn-cli typecheck`, targeted lifecycle/telemetry
  vitest, relevant full orchestration/board slice, `git diff --check`, and focused
  touched-source line-count evidence are recorded. The broad helper is known noisy in
  this checkout because it counts nested `node_modules`, `.turbo`, assets, and docs; do
  not treat that tooling output as source-size evidence without filtering. No M11
  control surface may start while any finding remains open or deferred.
- **Team:** architecture-mode single implementer; **review:** fail-safe/recovery
  reviewer plus department integration review focused on runtime lifecycle and shutdown.

### M11 — Dashboard / control surface (brief Phase 10) (complete, 2026-06-24)

- **Goal:** expose workers/leases/queue/quotas/worktrees/review/QA/cost in the web UI
  with **concrete** labels (no "AI team / smart mode / auto magic").
- **Blocking precondition:** M10.5 was complete and the M1–M10 audit had zero known open
  defects. Dashboard work must not add controls over a runtime whose lifecycle/recovery
  invariants are still defective.
- **Delivered:** `/orchestration` observe-first dashboard consuming real
  `/api/orchestration/` routes for workers, leases, queue, allocations,
  continuations, telemetry, worktrees, and dual-lane manifests. Mutating actions
  were limited to failed-continuation retry and explicit dual-lane winner
  selection. Backend preflight patched live-headroom filtering for failed
  continuation retry and orchestration-backed ticket dispatch.
- **Exit gate:** UI reflects real scheduler state; controls are auth-gated and
  no control claims an action it cannot perform.
- **Team:** department GUI specialist (this is where the department's UX strength fits).

### M12 — Safe controls (complete, 2026-06-24)

- **Goal:** add operator-safe global queue pause/resume and running-lease stop
  controls after M11, without raw diff/prompt/output viewing, automatic patch
  integration, or per-task queue pause.
- **Delivered:** durable global queue pause metadata in the orchestration store;
  runtime `pauseQueue`, `resumeQueue`, and `getControlState`; paused runtime
  suppresses queued continuation dispatch on release/expiry/retry and resumes
  through live-headroom-aware retry. Added `POST /api/orchestration/queue/pause`,
  `POST /api/orchestration/queue/resume`, and `POST /api/orchestration/leases/stop`.
  Lease stop resolves the mapped Jinn session via
  `transportMeta.orchestrationLease.leaseId`, interrupts an interruptible running
  session without directly releasing the lease, releases immediately only when
  the mapped session is already terminal, and returns `409` without release for
  missing mappings or non-interruptible engines. The `/orchestration` dashboard
  exposes global queue pause/resume and Stop lease for running leases only.
- **Exit gate:** queue pause persists across runtime reopen; paused queues do not
  dispatch on release; resume uses live headroom; failed-continuation retry stays
  queued while paused; lease stop follows strict mapped-session semantics; UI
  renders paused/running/disabled/failure states with concrete labels.
- **Remaining boundary:** per-task queue controls, raw diff viewing, raw prompt or
  model-output viewing, and automatic patch integration remain deferred.

### M12.5 — Residual growth, mode, smoke, and recovery closure (implemented 2026-06-24)

- **Goal:** close post-M12 live-growth residuals without implementing held-team
  allocations or runtime-editable employees.
- **Delivered:** allocation lifecycle transitions with `updatedAt`; terminal allocation
  retention defaults of 24 hours and 1,000 newest records; internal scheduler telemetry
  retention defaults of 24 hours and 2,000 newest events; corrupt DB recovery manifests
  under `~/.jinn/orchestration-recovery/`; `GET /api/orchestration/status`
  `recoveryNotices`; read-only `jinn recovery notices`; opt-in
  `scripts/orchestration-smoke.mjs`; implemented `architecture` and `local_heavy`
  coordinator/live run modes with examples.
- **Boundary:** append-only JSONL run telemetry is unchanged. Corrupt DB recovery still
  quarantines and starts empty; there is no automatic restore or requeue. Per-task pause,
  raw diff/prompt/output viewing, automatic patch integration, held-team allocation, and
  runtime employee mutation remain deferred.
- **M13 design gate:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-24-m13-holds-auth-design.md`
  records that holds must be durable TTL records separate from leases, must not dispatch
  workers, must expire automatically, and must wait for an accepted auth model and
  adversarial review before implementation.

## 6. Operating modes (assembled by coordinators)

Risk-tiered team assembly (brief Modes 1–5), built incrementally (M5 → M12.5):

1. **single_worker** — implementer → deterministic QA → release (small changes).
2. **single_worker_with_review** — implementer → opposite-family reviewer → fix → QA
   (the normal serious-work mode).
3. **architecture** — architect → implementer → independent reviewer → adversarial
   reviewer → QA (orchestration/runtime/shell/persistence changes — *this program
   itself* uses this mode; implemented M12.5).
4. **dual_lane** — OpenAI lane ∥ Anthropic lane → comparison → integration selection →
   QA (high-risk/high-value only; M8).
5. **local_heavy** — Ollama/Pi for summarize/triage/dedup/clustering/lint-explain/config-
   validation; local workers reduce frontier load and never own high-risk judgment
   (implemented M12.5).

Risk-based assembly prevents **review theater** (R6): small tasks do not get full teams.

---

## 7. Consolidated file plan (line budgets enforce the 800-line rule)

All new code files target **< 800 lines** (skill blocker; current `scheduler.ts` = 415).
Split before a file approaches the limit. New runtime state under `JINN_HOME` only.
**The 800-line limit applies to human-authored *source* files only** — markdown/docs
(this plan, READMEs, specs, session logs) are **exempt** and never a gate blocker.

| File (new unless noted) | Milestone | Purpose | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orchestration/store.ts` | M1 | SQLite persistence (WAL, migrations) | ≤350 |
| `orchestration/persistent-scheduler.ts` | M1 | hydrate + write-through over core | ≤250 |

| `orchestration/run-mode.ts` | M5 | allocate→run→review→QA→release | ≤400 |
| `orchestration/runtime.ts` | M5 | daemon-boot owner: single scheduler + expiry/retry timer + shutdown close | ≤200 |
| `gateway/api/orchestration-routes.ts` (modify) | M5 | read shared boot instance; open-per-request only as no-daemon fallback | keep ≤400 |
| `shared/config-schema.ts` + `types.ts` (modify) | M5 | `orchestration.enabled` flag (off by default) | small |
| `orchestration/worktree.ts` | M6 | git worktree lifecycle + reaper | ≤350 |

| `orchestration/run-mode.ts` (modify or split) | M10.5 | pre-dispatch lease release invariant | split before growth |
| `orchestration/routing-headroom.ts` + runtime wiring | M10.5 | live headroom before lease creation | small |
| `orchestration/telemetry.ts` (modify or split) | M10.5 | bounded score reads/append behavior | split if needed |
| `scripts/orchestration-smoke.mjs` | M3+ | opt-in real-provider smoke | ≤200 |
| `shared/paths.ts` (modify) | M1 | add `ORCH_DB`, orchestration dirs | small |
| `packages/web/...` | M11 | dashboard views | per-file ≤800 |

Plus a co-located `__tests__/*.test.ts` for every module (TDD per the gate loop).

## 8. The `plan-prototype-build` gate loop (applied to each milestone)

Each milestone is one autonomous, walk-away gated run. **Do not pause for approval
between gates within a milestone**; infer conservative defaults and record assumptions.
Gates per `SKILL.md`:

- **Gate 0 — Orient:** re-read `AGENTS.md`, the relevant subsystem, this plan's
  milestone section, current `git status`; confirm Giles Job Plan / waiver; record
  assumptions + a milestone risk register.
- **Gate 1 — Plan:** normalize the milestone into a `gated_execution_plan.md`
  (template), with file plan, IO contract, test plan, audit plan, acceptance criteria,
  scope-pressure policy.
- **Gate 2 — Skeleton:** module boundaries + test harness + doc stub; verify it builds;
  line counts checked.
- **Gate 3 — Core workflow:** the milestone's primary non-UI behavior; deterministic
  error behavior; unit tests (write the failing test first, per the hermes-plan TDD
  rhythm used in this repo).
- **Gate 4 — Interface/IO/persistence:** CLI/API/(UI) surface; explicit save/load;
  user-visible errors; path/file validation; no silent overwrite.
- **Gate 5 — Hardening + audit repair:** modularity, hidden globals, error/data-loss
  paths, dependency sprawl, line-count, test gaps, doc drift. Patch only bounded
  defects.
- **Gate 6 — Docs/diagrams:** update `docs/orchestration/README.md`,
  `docs/feature_inventory.md` (new surfaces), Mermaid arch/workflow diagrams, session
  log under `docs/logs/session/MMYYYY/`. No doc claims unsupported by code.
- **Gate 7 — Final QA/QC + handoff:** line-count enforcement; `pnpm typecheck` + targeted
  vitest + (where touched) `pnpm test`; manual workflow validation; defect-ledger
  closure; residual-risk + skipped-check summary; final file/artifact map.

**Audit between gates:** after each implementation gate, run an audit (the skill's
adversarial fallback, or a department reviewer). Every finding enters the defect ledger
with a disposition (`fixed | verified-not-a-defect | deferred-with-risk |
blocked-by-missing-input | blocked-by-tooling`). No finding disappears.

**Department cadence (when to bring the team in):**
- After M1/M2 design: architecture review, failure-mode review, schema/terminology
  critique, test-gap review.
- After M5 (first real mode): scheduler adversarial review, queue/deadlock/lease-recovery
  review, real-task smoke.
- After M8/M11: workflow critique + UX/control-surface design.
- **Never** for: initial implementation of a slice, broad simultaneous refactors, or
  self-hosted orchestration of the orchestration build (the snake eating its tail).

---

## 9. Test / validation plan (deterministic first; failsafes; error-checking)

### 9.1 Commands (every milestone, Gate 7)

```bash
# from packages/jinn
npx vitest run src/orchestration/**/*.test.ts src/cli/__tests__/*orchestration*.test.ts
npm run typecheck
# from repo root
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test            # full turbo run; if the known jinn-cli timeout flakiness recurs,
                     # rerun the failing file in isolation and record both results
bash ~/vscode/agent-skills/30_plan/plan-prototype-build/tools/line_count_check.sh
git diff --check
```

### 9.2 Scheduler simulation scenarios (extend the existing 14 cases — keep them green)

one-task/one-worker · two-tasks/one-worker (queue) · maxConcurrency before block ·
qualified worker unavailable → blocked_resource · opposite-family reviewer selection ·
all workers busy · lease timeout/expiry · heartbeat recovery · worker failure → release
· quota exhausted (atomic, no partial team) · local worker preferred for cheap task ·
high-priority queued behind normal resumes first · atomic allocation prevents deadlock.

### 9.3 Per-milestone additions

- **M1:** restart round-trip; corrupt-DB recovery; transaction atomicity (crash → no
  half-allocation); expired-lease purge on hydrate.
- **M2/M3:** adapter rejects start without owned lease; structured error on failure;
  **claude PTY-path contract test** (no headless bypass); rate-limited engine filtered.
- **M5:** ≥5 low-risk tasks E2E with `mock`/local workers; collision impossible (two
  tasks never lease one worker under load); lease TTL + watchdog bounds every run;
  heartbeat renews `leaseExpiresAt` (a turn longer than `leaseDurationMs` keeps its worker,
  is not re-leased); lease released on every terminal run-web-session path (error, stall,
  rate-limit fallback, late recovery, deleted session); observe routes read the single boot
  instance (no stale second-handle read).
- **M6:** implementer session receives the isolated worktree `cwd`; reviewer session
  receives a diff-only bundle derived from that worktree; implementer lease release does not remove
  the worktree before review; task-end cleanup removes completed worktrees; runtime
  reaper finds + removes abandoned worktrees; non-git cwd downgrade logged; max-worktrees
  bound enforced.
- **M7:** reviewer-selection explainability; same-family fallback permit/forbid honored.
- **M8:** identical brief to both lanes; isolated worktrees; comparison report;
  explicit selection; loser archived.
- **M9:** no double-dispatch (board-worker + scheduler); org YAML never mutated; disable
  → exact prior behavior.
- **M10:** every run emits a telemetry line; summarizer aggregates; no secrets in output.
- **M10.5:** active config reload does not close active runtime; graceful shutdown
  drains/releases before runtime close; pre-dispatch failures release leases; stale
  `dispatching` continuations recover on boot; live headroom filters before leasing;
  deferred org refresh applies after drain; empirical routing uses bounded telemetry IO.

### 9.4 Failsafes & error-checking (cross-cutting)

- **Lease TTL + heartbeat watchdog** on every live run — no unbounded background work
  (mirror cron's `inFlight`/timeout discipline).
- **Atomic allocation** — required team all-or-nothing; never reserve half a team
  (deadlock guard, already in the core; persistence must preserve it — M1).
- **Blocked tasks suspend** — no live model "waits"; scheduler wakes on resource events
  (`retryQueued`). No polling loop burns compute.
- **Idempotent recovery** — expired/abandoned leases release workers on boot + timer.
- **Structured provider errors** — adapters return typed errors, never throw raw into the
  scheduler; failures map to `EngineFailureReason` where possible.
- **No real provider in unit tests** — real execution only via the opt-in smoke script.
- **Path/disk safety** — worktree root validated; max-worktrees cap; reaper bounds disk.
- **Secret hygiene** — no tokens/credentials in telemetry, logs, or worktree branches.

## 10. Risk register (brief risks + repo-specific risks discovered)

| # | Risk | Mitigation | Verifying check |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Two dispatchers (board-worker + scheduler) collide on one engine/employee | Scheduler is single allocator (D6); board-worker defers/gated (M9) | M9 collision test; disable→regression test |
| R2 | New per-worker leasing conflicts with per-session-key `SessionQueue` | Scheduler sits *above* session manager; different axes (D1) | M5 collision + ordering tests |
| R3 | Agent collision (two tasks, one worker) | Valid owned lease required for all execution; adapter rejects otherwise (D2); heartbeat renews `leaseExpiresAt` so a long turn's lease never expires mid-run (M5 precond. 4) | adapter contract test; M5 load test; long-turn lease-renewal test (turn > `leaseDurationMs` keeps worker) |
| R4 | Deadlock / half-allocated teams | Atomic allocation + lease TTLs (core); persistence preserves atomicity (M1) | atomic-allocation test (×2: core + persisted) |
| R5 | State loss on daemon restart | Durable SQLite + hydrate-on-boot (D3, M1) | restart round-trip test |
| R6 | Review theater (full teams for trivial tasks) | Risk-based team assembly; modes 1–5 (§6) | mode-selection tests |
| R7 | Provider-specific assumptions leak into scheduler | Adapters below scheduler; core has zero engine imports (D2) | import-boundary lint/test |
| R8 | Local models over-trusted / routing into a rate-limited engine | local = triage only; `engineHasHeadroom` filter (D4) | M3 headroom test |
| R9 | **Subscription/PTY billing path broken** (AGENTS.md) | Claude forced through interactive PTY; no headless bypass (D7) | M3 PTY-path contract test |
| R10 | Orchestrator becomes DAWES-specific | Generic Cuttlefish-compatible primitives only; policy packs downstream | design review; no DAWES strings in core |
| R11 | Worktree disk blowup / orphans | Task/lane-scoped, capped, reaped; git-only with downgrade (D5) | reaper + max-worktrees tests |
| R12 | Naming collision (Employee/Manager vs Worker/Coordinator) | Vocabularies kept separate; bridge maps (D6, §4) | forbidden-term grep in orchestration/** |
| R13 | Building too much before first simulation | No real execution until M2 sim/contract green; smoke opt-in (D8) | gate ordering; CI excludes smoke |
| R14 | `pnpm test` flakiness (known jinn-cli timeouts) masks real failures | Rerun failing file in isolation; record both; never declare green on a flake | Gate 7 evidence discipline |
| R15 | Self-hosting recursion (department rebuilds its own coordinator) | One implementer per slice; department review-only until M5+ | execution-strategy adherence |
| R16 | Config reload closes an active orchestration runtime | M10.5 active-work-safe runtime swap + pending refresh replay | config-reload-with-running-lease test |
| R17 | Shutdown closes runtime before active turns can release leases | M10.5 ordered shutdown/drain and tracked in-flight orchestration work | graceful-shutdown-during-run test |
| R18 | Pre-dispatch launch failure leaks allocated leases | M10.5 release invariant for all allocated leases before/after dispatch setup | missing-engine/session-write-failure lease-release tests |
| R19 | Stale `dispatching` continuation blocks recovery/drain forever | M10.5 boot reconciliation for stale dispatching continuations | crash-after-claim restart test |
| R20 | Live allocation leases rate-limited/unavailable engines | M10.5 headroom filter before live lease creation | exhausted-engine no-lease test |
| R21 | Deferred org-worker refresh is never applied after active work drains | M10.5 pending-org-refresh replay after drain | org-reload-during-active-work test |
| R22 | Empirical telemetry IO grows into daemon startup/hot-path stalls | M10.5 bounded telemetry scoring reads and bounded append behavior | large-telemetry startup budget test |

---

## 11. Persistence & telemetry contract

- **Config (declarative):** `~/.jinn/orchestration/{workers,roles,coordinators,quotas}.yaml`
  (mirrors `org/`). Validated by the existing Zod schemas; invalid config fails with a
  path-specific message before any execution.
- **Runtime state (durable):** `~/.jinn/orchestration.db` (SQLite/WAL) — leases,
  allocations, queue_items, telemetry index. Never committed.
- **Telemetry (append-only):** `~/.jinn/logs/orchestration-telemetry.jsonl` (git-ignored,
  per `logs/` convention). Allocation *decisions* may also append to the hash-chained
  `~/.jinn/audit.jsonl` (`shared/audit-log.ts`) for tamper-evidence.
- **No secrets** anywhere in the above.

---

## 12. Security baseline

Local-low sensitivity, but enforce: no telemetry/network beyond what a worker's engine
already does; no secrets in logs/telemetry/branches; validate worktree paths and config
file paths; atomic-ish writes (`shared/safe-write.ts` pattern); deterministic handling
of malformed config/task files; orchestration state separate from app code; document
trust assumptions and the (out-of-scope) threat model in `docs/orchestration/README.md`.
All new HTTP routes auth-gated by the existing token (`gateway/auth.ts`).

---

## 13. Scope-pressure policy

Under pressure, preserve the **primary end-to-end path** (allocate → lease → run →
release → telemetry) and cut secondary scope in this order: dual-lane (M8) → dashboard
controls (M11, ship read-only views) → org bridge (M9) → empirical-routing scoring
(keep raw telemetry). Never cut: atomicity, lease exclusivity, billing-path safety,
worktree isolation, deterministic tests, or M10.5 lifecycle hardening. M11 dashboard
controls are explicitly lower priority than closing known runtime lifecycle defects.
Document every deferral with residual risk.

## 14. Acceptance criteria

**Global (full capability):** a task brief + coordinator template assembles a real team
from configured/synthesized workers; required roles allocate atomically or the task
queues; leases are exclusive and TTL-bounded; turns run through the existing engine path
(claude via PTY); worktrees isolate lanes; cross-family review is enforced and
explainable; dual-lane competition produces a comparison + explicit selection; every run
emits durable telemetry; state survives restart; the dashboard reflects real state with
concrete labels; **existing tests stay green and the subscription billing path is
intact.** Before any operator-facing control surface is added, the M1–M10 audit
findings must be closed or explicitly reclassified as non-defects with evidence; the
target end state is **zero known open defects**.

**Per milestone:** the Exit gate listed in §5, validated by §9 and closed in the
milestone's defect ledger.

## 15. Launch prompts (hand one of these to a single implementer per milestone)

Each launch prompt is the milestone's contract. Template (fill `<M#>` from §5):

```text
Use the plan-prototype-build skill (~/vscode/agent-skills/30_plan/plan-prototype-build/).
Build milestone <M#> from docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-23-matrix-orchestration.md
autonomously through Gates 0–7. Do not pause between gates; infer conservative defaults
and record assumptions.

repo_path: /home/ericl/Work/vscode/public_share/jinn
target_language: TypeScript (ESM, .js import suffixes), Node >=24
target_platform: jinn-cli daemon + CLI (+ packages/web for M11)
authority: patch-authorized
audit_skill_path: <adversarial fallback, or assign a department reviewer>

Preconditions (BLOCKING):
- Read AGENTS.md and §1/§3 of the plan first.
- Obtain a Giles Job Plan for this slice, or an explicit one-session waiver from the
  operator (AGENTS.md Software Delivery Routing). Do not spawn implementation work first.
- Do NOT touch live ~/.jinn or port 7777; tests use temp dirs only.

Scope: exactly milestone <M#> Deliverables (plan §5). Honor the design rulings D1–D8
(plan §3): scheduler-above-session, thin adapter over Engine, durable SQLite, usage-aware
routing, task/lane-scoped git worktrees, single-allocator, **claude interactive-PTY billing
path is sacrosanct (D7)**, determinism preserved.

Non-goals: no real provider calls outside the opt-in smoke script; no DAWES specifics;
no Employee/Manager/Department terms in orchestration/**; no out-of-milestone work; no
source file over 800 lines (split first; markdown/docs are exempt).

Acceptance: the milestone Exit gate (§5), the relevant tests (§9), pnpm typecheck +
targeted vitest green, line-count check clean, docs/feature_inventory + session log
updated, defect ledger closed. Report what passed/failed/was-skipped with evidence.
```

Milestone-specific emphasis to append to the template:

- **M1:** "Mirror sessions/registry.ts init/migration pattern; prove restart round-trip
  and atomic (no half-written) allocation; keep the pure MatrixScheduler tests unchanged."
- **M2:** "Architecture-manager mode. The scheduler core must have ZERO concrete-engine
  imports. Adapter rejects start_task without a valid owned lease."
- **M3:** "Prove the claude worker runs via interactive PTY (cc_entrypoint=cli) with a
  contract test; filter rate-limited engines via usage-status.ts; sim mode unaffected."
- **M5:** "≥5 low-risk tasks E2E with mock/local workers; no collision, no leak, no lost
  worktrees, no unbounded runs (lease TTL + watchdog on every run). Resolve all four
  BLOCKING preconditions first — especially heartbeat-renews-`leaseExpiresAt` (today it
  does not; a turn outliving `leaseDurationMs` would let the worker be re-leased). Heartbeat
  on the 5s `runHeartbeat` interval, not raw `onActivity`. Release the lease on EVERY
  terminal path of run-web-session via `finally`. Allocate against the one live persistent
  scheduler, not the observe-only planner. Add `orchestration.enabled` (off by default);
  construct the single scheduler at boot and route the M4 observe endpoints through it."
- **M6:** "git-only implementation worktrees, lane isolation enforced, reviewer reads
  a diff-only bundle generated from the implementation worktree, worktree survives implementer lease release,
  orphan reaper uses the runtime boot+timer loop, non-git cwd downgrades with a log line."
- **M8:** "Only start once M1–M7 are stable; identical brief to both lanes; human
  selection by default; archive the loser."
- **M9:** "OrgWorkerAdapter is read-only over scanOrg; prove no double-dispatch with
  board-worker; disabling orchestration restores exact prior behavior."
- **M10.5:** "Close `docs/audits/2026-06-24-matrix-orchestration-m1-m10-audit.md`
  findings FSR-MATRIX-001/002/003, RRR-MATRIX-004, ONR-MATRIX-005/006, and
  FSR-MATRIX-007 before any M11 work. Prove active config reload keeps the current
  runtime bound until drain; graceful shutdown releases or marks leases/continuations
  recoverable before runtime close; missing-engine/session setup failures release
  leases; stale `dispatching` continuations recover on boot; live headroom is applied
  before lease creation; deferred org refresh replays after drain; empirical routing
  uses bounded telemetry IO. Do not add dashboard controls in this slice."
- **M11:** "Start only after M10.5 is green and the M1–M10 audit has zero known open
  defects. Controls must reflect real runtime state and must not mask lifecycle,
  recovery, or telemetry degradation."

---

## 16. Residual risks known before build

- **Concurrency-model seam (D1)** is the subtlest integration; M5 must prove the
  lease/SessionQueue interaction under load before M6–M8 build on it.
- **Worktrees (M6)** are entirely new to this repo — expect iteration on the daemon's
  arbitrary-`cwd` reality (the daemon runs from `JINN_HOME`, tasks target other repos).
- **`pnpm test` jinn-cli timeout flakiness** (observed by Codex) can mask regressions;
  Gate 7 must rerun failing files in isolation and record both results — never declare
  green on a flake (R14).
- **Org/board reconciliation (M9)** changes a *live* dispatch path; treat as
  architecture-mode with a full regression pass.
- This plan assumes the inert Phase-1 scaffold remains the decision core; if a later
  milestone needs to change `MatrixScheduler` semantics, re-run the §9.2 simulation
  suite as a non-regression gate.
- **Post-M10 lifecycle audit (2026-06-24)** found seven known defects that block M11
  controls. Treat them as M10.5 blockers, not optional cleanup.

### M10.5 carry-forward blockers (closed 2026-06-24)

Source audit: `docs/audits/2026-06-24-matrix-orchestration-m1-m10-audit.md`.

- `FSR-MATRIX-001` — fixed by active-work-safe runtime swap and deferred config refresh.
- `FSR-MATRIX-002` — fixed by gateway shutdown runtime preparation before store close.
- `FSR-MATRIX-003` — fixed by releasing still-running leases on every setup/dispatch
  exception path.
- `RRR-MATRIX-004` — fixed by boot recovery for stale `dispatching` continuations.
- `ONR-MATRIX-005` — fixed by headroom-aware live allocation before lease creation.
- `ONR-MATRIX-006` — fixed by deferred org/config refresh replay after drain.
- `FSR-MATRIX-007` — fixed by bounded telemetry score reads and non-fsync hot-path
  appends.

M11 may start only after M10.5 validation remains green and no new known blockers are
identified.

### M1 carry-forward residuals (updated 2026-06-24)

M1 passed its exit gate; these are *non-blocking-for-M1* items that **must** be resolved
before the scheduler goes live (M5) or telemetry durably grows (M10):

- **Snapshot write amplification.** Closed before M12.5 by incremental snapshot deltas.
- **Telemetry coupled to the snapshot.** Closed in M12.5 by internal scheduler telemetry
  pruning. Durable run telemetry remains append-only JSONL.
- **Unbounded `allocations` map.** Closed in M12.5 by allocation lifecycle states,
  `updatedAt`, and terminal retention/count pruning. Running allocations are never pruned.
- **Corrupt-recovery = data loss.** Partially mitigated in M12.5 by recovery manifests,
  telemetry detail with manifest path, API status notices, and read-only CLI observation.
  Automatic restore/requeue remains intentionally deferred because the corrupt DB is
  untrusted.
- **Not daemon-wired (expected).** M1 is code-level only; single-instance boot
  hydrate/close is owned by M4/M5, not a defect.
```
