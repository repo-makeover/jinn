# Feature Inventory

## Web UI

### Dashboard route shell
- `packages/web/src/main.tsx`
- The public dashboard is a Vite React app served by the gateway daemon.
- Implemented routes are:
  - `/` for the primary chat workspace; `/chat` redirects to `/`.
  - `/talk` for multi-agent talk sessions.
  - `/kanban` for department ticket boards and dispatch controls.
  - `/orchestration` for matrix orchestration operations.
  - `/cron` for scheduled job management.
  - `/logs` for runtime log inspection.
  - `/limits` for usage/rate-limit visibility.
  - `/org` for organization and employee configuration.
  - `/settings` for gateway, engine, connector, and feature configuration.
  - `/skills` for local skill browsing/management.
  - `/file` for file viewing.
- `/redesign` is development-only and is not part of the public operator surface.

### Kanban ticket live session inspector
- `packages/web/src/components/kanban/ticket-detail-panel.tsx`
- In-progress tickets can show a live session summary in the detail panel:
  - session status
  - engine and model
  - accumulated session cost
  - relative last-activity heartbeat
  - latest transcript tail (capped to 8 messages)
  - link to open the full live chat view
- This is session-level liveness only. It reflects the gateway session state and transcript, not process-level CPU/PID health.

### Kanban recycle bin
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/board-service.ts`
- `packages/web/src/routes/kanban/page.tsx`
- Deleted kanban tickets move into a recycle bin instead of being purged immediately.
- The retention window defaults to 3 days and is configurable from 0 to 7 days in the kanban UI.
- `0` means immediate purge.
- Tickets remain restorable from the "Recently deleted" section until their retention window expires.

### Kanban optimistic save protection
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/board-service.ts`
- `packages/web/src/routes/kanban/page.tsx`
- Web board saves send each ticket's last observed `updatedAt` as `baseUpdatedAt`.
- The gateway rejects stale ticket updates or stale deletion attempts with HTTP `409`
  and `reason: "board-conflict"` instead of overwriting newer server state.
- Running board-linked tickets preserve active `sessionId` and `source` metadata across
  fresh saves so a stale layout cannot silently move a dispatched ticket back to `todo`.

### Matrix orchestration operations dashboard
- `packages/web/src/routes/orchestration/page.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/lib/orchestration-api.ts`
- `/orchestration` shows real orchestration status, workers, running leases,
  blocked queue items, durable continuations, dual-lane selection manifests,
  managed worktrees, and telemetry/cost summaries.
- Dashboard actions are deliberately limited to safe backend actions: retry a
  continuation only when it is `failed`, select or apply a dual-lane winner,
  pause/resume the global queue or one queued task, create/extend/cancel
  TTL-bounded holds, view raw prompt/output/diff artifacts, requeue explicitly
  selected recovery records, and stop a running lease through its mapped Jinn
  session interruption path.
- Disabled action controls explain the state boundary. Dual-lane apply refuses
  dirty base worktrees, missing winner worktrees, empty patches, and patch
  conflicts; it applies only unstaged base-repo changes.

### Organization agent create/edit panel
- `packages/web/src/routes/org/page.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/org/employee-create-form.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/components/org/employee-editor.tsx`
- `/org` can now open a right-side "Add agent" form that creates a new org
  employee YAML file through the gateway.
- The create/edit surfaces cover agent id, display name, department, reports-to,
  level (`manager`, `senior`, `junior` mapped to internal `employee` rank),
  engine/model/effort, including the local `ollama` and `kilo` engine options, optional same-engine fallback model, persona,
  CLI flags, and always-notify behavior.

### Settings orchestration controls
- `packages/web/src/routes/settings/page.tsx`
- `packages/web/src/routes/settings/settings-config-sections.tsx`
- `/settings` now exposes first-class orchestration runtime controls including
  the enable toggle plus config/db/worktree paths, max worktrees, same-family
  reviewer fallback, and empirical routing.

## CLI

### Provider-neutral matrix orchestration dry-runs and observe surfaces
- `packages/jinn/src/orchestration/*`
- `packages/jinn/src/cli/orchestration.ts`
- `packages/jinn/bin/jinn.ts`
- `jinn workers list --config-dir <dir> [--json]` loads explicit matrix worker config and prints available workers.
- `jinn scheduler allocate <task-file> --config-dir <dir> --dry-run [--json]` validates a task request and performs fake-worker allocation only.
- `jinn scheduler simulate <scenario-file> --config-dir <dir> [--json]` runs deterministic allocation/release/heartbeat/expiry scenario steps against in-memory scheduler state.
- `jinn scheduler plan <task-file> --config-dir <dir> [--db-path <path>] [--json]` expands a coordinator template into an observe-only allocation plan.
- `jinn leases list --config-dir <dir> [--db-path <path>] [--json]` lists durable orchestration leases when a DB exists.
- `jinn queue list --config-dir <dir> [--db-path <path>] [--json]` lists durable blocked-resource queue items when a DB exists.
- `jinn queue pause-task|resume-task --task-id <id> --coordinator-id <id> [--json]` pauses or resumes one queued task through the live gateway.
- `jinn run --mode single_worker|single_worker_with_review|dual_lane|architecture|local_heavy --task <file> [--json]` posts a live task brief to the running gateway; the daemon must have `orchestration.enabled: true`.
- `jinn dual-lane select --task-id <id> --coordinator-id <id> --winner openai|anthropic [--json]` explicitly selects a completed dual-lane winner, archives the loser diff/metadata, and removes the loser worktree.
- `jinn dual-lane apply --task-id <id> --coordinator-id <id> --winner openai|anthropic [--json]` applies the selected or selection-required winner patch to the base repo as unstaged changes only.
- `jinn holds list|create|extend|cancel` manages TTL-bounded orchestration holds with manager-scoped authorization.
- `jinn artifacts view --task-id <id> --coordinator-id <id> --kind diff|prompt|output [--json]` displays raw dual-lane artifacts for authenticated operators.
- `jinn continuations list [--json]` lists durable blocked/failed continuation records through the running gateway.
- `jinn continuations retry --task-id <id> --coordinator-id <id> [--json]` re-attempts a previously failed live continuation through the running gateway.
- `jinn scheduler stats [--path <file>] [--json]` summarizes append-only orchestration run telemetry by provider, family, role, worker, and disposition.
- `jinn recovery notices [--json]` lists recent corrupt orchestration DB recovery manifests.
- `jinn recovery requeue --manifest <path> --task-id <id> --coordinator-id <id> --manager-name <name> [--json]` imports one parsed recovered continuation as queued and task-paused; it never dispatches automatically.
- `scripts/orchestration-smoke.mjs` is an opt-in live-daemon smoke script; without `JINN_ORCHESTRATION_SMOKE=1`, it prints a skip message and exits 0.
- `jinn worktree create <task-file> [--lane <name>] [--json]` creates a managed git worktree for a task/lane when the task cwd is inside a git repo.
- `jinn worktree diff <task-file> [--lane <name>] [--json]` prints the diff for a managed task/lane worktree.
- `jinn worktree cleanup <task-file> [--lane <name>] [--json]` removes a managed task/lane worktree.
- Dry-run/list/plan commands remain inert and explicit-path based. `jinn run` is opt-in live execution through the daemon-owned scheduler and existing Jinn session path.
- `single_worker_with_review` run output includes reviewer-family policy explanations. Same-family reviewer fallback is forbidden by default and only enabled by `orchestration.sameFamilyReviewerFallback: true`.
- Live run output can now end in `ok: false, state: "failed"` when any leased role session errors; blocked runs remain `state: "blocked_resource"`.
- Fidelity gaps:
  - A SQLite store, persistent scheduler wrapper, and daemon runtime now exist for leases, allocations, queue items, and telemetry events.
  - Provider-adapter contract modules now exist for `stub`, `manual`, `local_echo`, `mock`, and experimental opt-in live adapter parity tests for existing Jinn engine ids via an injected engine map. The default registry used by dry-runs remains inert-only, and production live orchestration does not route through the live adapter factory.
  - Live orchestration allocation applies usage-aware headroom before creating leases, filtering unavailable, exhausted, or below-threshold engines while simulation mode stays deterministic.
  - Worktree execution is task/lane-scoped: implementation lanes can run in isolated git worktrees, reviewers inspect generated diff bundles instead of the implementation tree, and the runtime reaper removes abandoned managed worktrees plus review bundles older than 24 hours.
  - Dual-lane mode allocates OpenAI and Anthropic implementer roles atomically, sends both lanes an identical prompt in isolated worktrees, returns a deterministic comparison report, requires explicit human selection keyed by `taskId + coordinatorId`, records raw prompt/output/diff artifacts, and can apply the selected patch as unstaged base-repo changes only.
  - Board-originated ticket dispatch is scheduler-aware when `orchestration.enabled: true`: manual dispatch and the board worker allocate an exact synthesized org worker role before session launch and release the lease after the run settles.
  - Durable telemetry is appended to `~/.jinn/logs/orchestration-telemetry.jsonl` for scheduler-owned live runs, dual-lane selection outcomes, and scheduler-owned board/manual ticket dispatch. Prompts, raw model output, raw diffs, cwd/worktree paths, credentials, headers, and env are not logged.
  - `orchestration.empiricalRouting: true` lets runtime startup use decayed historical telemetry scores as a deterministic worker tie-break after hard constraints and explicit tier/cost preferences.
  - Runtime reload/shutdown paths preserve active orchestration work, replay deferred org/config refresh after drain, recover stale `dispatching` continuations, and release owned leases before closing persistent state.
  - Allocation lifecycle and retention are bounded: running allocations remain protected, terminal allocations default to 24-hour retention with a 1,000-record cap, internal scheduler telemetry defaults to 24-hour retention with a 2,000-event cap, append-only JSONL run telemetry is compacted to 90 days or 10,000 records, and recovery notices/quarantine sidecars are compacted to 30 days or 100 groups.
  - `architecture` mode requires architect, implementer, independent reviewer, adversarial reviewer, and QA roles in the resolved request. `local_heavy` rejects editing/coding roles and restricts allocation to local, near-zero, or low-cost workers.
  - The public CLI dry-runs and plans do not write the durable store; list commands read existing durable state only.
  - The `/orchestration` dashboard exposes failed-continuation retry, explicit dual-lane selection and apply, global and per-task queue pause/resume, raw artifact viewing, holds, recovery requeue, and strict running-lease stop.

## API

### Artifact registry routes
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/api/routes/artifacts.ts`
- `packages/jinn/src/sessions/registry/files.ts`
- Uploaded files, downloaded files, session attachments, and explicitly
  registered local outputs are persisted in the SQLite file/artifact registry
  with artifact id, path, MIME/type, size, SHA256, created time, producing run id
  when known, source URL/path, tags, notes, and artifact kind.
- Supported artifact kinds are `generated`, `input`, `downloaded`, and `manual`.
- `GET /api/artifacts` lists registry entries with optional `runId`, `kind`,
  `tag`, `q`, `sourceUrl`, `sourcePath`, and `limit` filters.
- `GET /api/artifacts/:id` returns one artifact plus current on-disk existence
  and its `/api/files/:id` download URL.
- `POST /api/artifacts/register` records an existing local file as an artifact,
  computes its SHA256, and stores optional run/source/tags/notes metadata.
- `PATCH /api/artifacts/:id` updates mutable metadata fields without moving the
  file.
- `POST /api/artifacts/validate` checks expected artifact ids and paths against
  registry records and current disk existence.
- `GET /api/artifacts/bundle?runId=<id>` returns an exportable run-bundle
  manifest for artifacts produced by one run. It does not package bytes into an
  archive in this implementation.

### Session run-resource attachments
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/run-attachments.ts`
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/api/routes/session-write.ts`
- Sessions now support normalized run-resource attachments for local files,
  folders, URLs, and previously registered artifacts.
- Attachment metadata includes path or URL, artifact id when known, local-file
  SHA256 when available, `read_only` vs `writable` access, intended use, and
  producing run id when known.
- `POST /api/sessions` and `POST /api/sessions/:id/message` accept legacy
  attachment id arrays plus richer `resources` objects; normalized attachments
  are persisted on the session and reused for handoffs/subsequent turns.
- `GET /api/sessions/:id/resources` lists the session's normalized run resources.
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/resources` attaches resources to an existing run
  without sending a prompt.
- Engine dispatch still receives exact local file paths when available, while
  the prompt also includes a structured "Attached resources" block for folders,
  URLs, access mode, intended use, artifact linkage, and producing-run context.

### Human checkpoints and approval gates
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/checkpoints.ts`
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/api/routes/checkpoints.ts`
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/api/routes/approvals.ts`
- Jinn now exposes a generic human-checkpoint primitive on top of the existing
  approval store, so runs can pause for explicit human decisions without
  inventing producer-specific pause flows.
- Checkpoints record the decision needed, why it is needed, affected files,
  artifacts, and actions, allowed human options (`approved`, `rejected`,
  `deferred`, `revised`), approver identity when available, timestamp,
  decision notes, and resulting action.
- `POST /api/checkpoints` creates a checkpoint for a session and, by default,
  pauses the session in `waiting` with a visible notification trail.
- `GET /api/checkpoints` and `GET /api/checkpoints/:id` expose the checkpoint
  queue and history.
- `POST /api/checkpoints/:id/decision` records a human decision and either
  keeps the run paused, stops it, records the outcome only, or resumes the
  session with a stored or supplied prompt.
- Existing fallback approvals continue to work through `/api/approvals/*`, but
  the underlying store now captures decision notes and resulting actions for the
  broader checkpoint model too.

### Exportable run bundles
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/run-bundles.ts`
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/api/routes/session-write.ts`
- `POST /api/sessions/:id/bundle` exports a completed session into a portable
  run bundle under managed Jinn runtime storage.
- Each bundle includes `run.json`, `summary.md`, `artifacts/`, `logs/`,
  `manifest.json`, and `errors.json`.
- `run.json` captures the serialized session, messages, attachments, approvals,
  and checkpoints at export time.
- `summary.md` provides a human-readable overview of the run, prompt, resource
  attachments, checkpoints, and exported artifact counts.
- `artifacts/` copies only files produced by the run or explicitly attached as
  concrete files; folder attachments remain references in metadata and are not
  recursively copied.
- `logs/gateway.log` contains only session-relevant log lines filtered from the
  gateway log, so the bundle does not expose unrelated workspace activity.
- `manifest.json` inventories the bundle files, hashes, sizes, and high-level
  counts, forming the base contract for later import/replay work.

### Provider-neutral matrix orchestration observe routes
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/api/orchestration-routes.ts`
- `GET /api/orchestration/status` returns enabled/runtime-bound state, degraded
  reason, queue pause state, active counts, recent corrupt-DB recovery notices,
  and recent expired-lease interruption diagnostics.
- `GET /api/orchestration/workers` returns configured workers.
- `GET /api/orchestration/leases` returns existing durable orchestration leases.
- `GET /api/orchestration/queue` returns blocked-resource queue items, per-task pause records, missing roles, and resume triggers.
- `GET /api/orchestration/holds` returns active and inactive TTL-bounded hold records.
- `GET /api/orchestration/allocations` returns existing durable allocations.
- `GET /api/orchestration/continuations` returns durable blocked/failed continuation records.
- `GET /api/orchestration/telemetry/summary` returns bounded, summarized
  telemetry without raw records.
- `GET /api/orchestration/worktrees` returns managed worktree metadata without
  diffs.
- `GET /api/orchestration/dual-lane` returns sanitized dual-lane manifest summaries.
- `GET /api/orchestration/artifacts/:taskId/:kind?coordinatorId=<id>` returns bounded raw
  prompt, output, diff, or patch-apply artifact content for one run identity.
- `POST /api/orchestration/continuations/retry` re-attempts a failed continuation through the live runtime.
- `POST /api/orchestration/queue/pause` persists a global queue pause with an optional reason.
- `POST /api/orchestration/queue/resume` clears the global queue pause and retries queued work through live headroom.
- `POST /api/orchestration/queue/pause-task` and `POST /api/orchestration/queue/resume-task` persist and clear one queued task pause keyed by `taskId + coordinatorId`.
- `POST /api/orchestration/holds`, `POST /api/orchestration/holds/:id/extend`, and `POST /api/orchestration/holds/:id/cancel` manage TTL-bounded holds with `managerName` authorization.
- `POST /api/orchestration/leases/stop` interrupts the Jinn session mapped to a running lease, or releases immediately when the mapped session is terminal.
- `POST /api/orchestration/run` executes `single_worker`, `single_worker_with_review`, `dual_lane`, `architecture`, and `local_heavy` tasks through the daemon runtime.
- `POST /api/orchestration/dual-lane/select` selects a completed dual-lane winner keyed by `taskId + coordinatorId` and archives/discards the loser lane.
- `POST /api/orchestration/dual-lane/apply` applies a selected or selection-required winner patch keyed by `taskId + coordinatorId` to the base repo as unstaged changes only.
- `POST /api/orchestration/recovery/requeue` imports one parsed recovered continuation from an explicit recovery manifest by `taskId + coordinatorId` and leaves it task-paused until resumed.
- Run responses include `reviewPolicy.explanations` for reviewer selection, explicit same-family fallback, and blocked reviewer allocation.
- Blocked live runs persist a durable continuation keyed by task/coordinator and auto-resume on later resource availability.
- These routes inherit the existing `/api/*` gateway token gate; unsupported methods on each path return `405`.
- Fidelity gaps:
  - GET routes observe state only; POST controls require an enabled live runtime.
  - The run route allocates leases, creates sessions, heartbeats leases on the existing 5s runner interval, passes isolated worktree cwd values to eligible implementation sessions, hands reviewers diff bundles, and releases leases on terminal paths.
  - If no orchestration runtime exists, state routes retain the no-daemon/test fallback; the run route fails instead of opening its own live scheduler.
  - Corrupt orchestration DB recovery quarantines the DB/WAL/SHM sidecars, writes an operator manifest under `~/.jinn/orchestration-recovery/`, includes the manifest path in `store_corrupt_recovered` telemetry, and starts from an empty trusted store. Explicit requeue imports only parsed continuation/hold records and leaves work paused.
  - Lease stop does not release a running lease directly; the mapped run/session `finally` path remains release owner after interruption.
  - Runtime employee mutation and hold creation/extension/cancellation require `managerName`; managers can affect their hierarchy and executives can affect anyone.

### Kanban ticket dispatch scheduler bridge
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/org-worker-bridge.ts`
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/ticket-dispatch.ts`
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/board-worker.ts`
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/orchestration-runtime-factory.ts`
- When `orchestration.enabled: true`, manual ticket dispatch and the background board worker allocate an exact in-memory org-derived scheduler role before creating/running the board-linked session.
- Exact-worker dispatch applies live engine headroom before creating the lease,
  so unavailable, exhausted, or below-threshold engines do not get leased.
- A busy exact worker returns `orchestration-busy` and leaves the ticket in `todo`; no orchestration queue item is created because the board is already the durable backlog.
- Missing runtime or missing org-worker mapping returns `orchestration-unavailable` or `orchestration-worker-unmapped` and does not fall back to legacy direct dispatch.
- The manual dispatch route maps scheduler-specific failures to HTTP `409`.
- When orchestration is disabled, ticket dispatch keeps the legacy direct dispatch behavior.

### Internal session notification delivery
- `packages/jinn/src/sessions/notification-sink.ts`
- `packages/jinn/src/gateway/notification-sink.ts`
- Gateway-owned session callbacks use an injected in-process notification sink for
  parent-session, attached-talk, rate-limit, completion, and connector notifications.
- The direct sink avoids localhost loopback HTTP calls and repeated config file parsing
  on gateway hot paths. Callback helpers retain the old loopback path as a fallback
  for non-gateway and compatibility contexts.

### Kiro headless engine and estimated credit gauge
- Known diagnostic note: `docs/known-diagnostics.md` records the Kiro quota
  endpoint and Kiro-to-AWS routing gaps as accepted non-actionable diagnostics
  for future audits unless explicitly scoped.
- `kiro` is a registered headless engine. Work turns spawn:
  - `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive --trust-all-tools --model <model> [--effort <level>] [--resume-id <engineSessionId>] <prompt>`
- Session continuity is wired through Kiro's `--resume-id` flag. For fresh sessions, Jinn attempts a bounded `kiro-cli chat --list-sessions --format json` lookup and stores the newest returned session id when available.
- Kiro stdout is ANSI-stripped and the `Credits: X.XX - Time: ...` / `Credits: X.XX • Time: ...` footer is removed from the assistant answer. The footer value is accumulated in `~/.jinn/usage/kiro-credits.json`.
- The Kiro usage gauge is an estimate, not an authoritative provider quota. It uses `engines.kiro.creditBudget` and `engines.kiro.billingAnchorDay` to calculate remaining percentage, state, and reset time. If Kiro reports credit exhaustion during an actual turn, the normal usage-limit recovery path treats it as a blocking limit even if the local estimate was stale.
- Fidelity gaps:
  - Kiro credit usage depends on the CLI footer text; if Kiro changes that footer, the local ledger may stop updating until the parser is updated.
  - No stable local Kiro quota endpoint is wired, so the gauge cannot verify account-side credit balance.
  - This source tree does not contain a scheduler/provider map architecture for routing Kiro to AWS. No Kiro-to-AWS provider mapping was added.

### `GET /api/org/departments/:name/tickets/:id/session`
- Best-effort ticket-to-session resolver for the kanban panel.
- Returns `200 { found:false }` when no live or recent matching session can be resolved.
- When a match exists, returns compact session state plus the latest transcript tail (capped to 8 messages).
- Matching prefers the most recently active session and resolves by:
  - `session.transportMeta.boardTicketId === ticket.id`
  - persisted `ticket.sessionId` matching the session id or engine session id
  - channel/session keys containing the ticket id

## Runtime Paths

### Live Jinn path context
- `packages/jinn/src/shared/paths.ts`
- Runtime path exports remain import-compatible, but they now refresh from a shared
  path context instead of being fixed permanently at first module evaluation.
- Tests and runtime helpers can call `setJinnHomeForTest(<path>)` or
  `refreshJinnPaths()` to redirect `JINN_HOME`-derived paths without a module reset.
- `getJinnPaths()` returns an explicit snapshot for code that should avoid reading
  mutable module bindings directly.
