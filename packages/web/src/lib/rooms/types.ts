/**
 * View-model types for the chat "department project rooms" feature.
 *
 * These are DERIVED view models computed on the client from the existing
 * `/api/sessions` + `/api/org` payloads — they are NOT a second session schema
 * and nothing here is persisted. A `DepartmentRoom` groups the sessions that
 * belong to one department (derived via `employee.department`); a
 * `RoomTimelineEntry` is one agent's contribution within a room, labeled with a
 * speaker and an intended `@target` recipient.
 *
 * The pure grouping/aggregation logic lives in `./grouping.ts`; React components
 * only consume these shapes (keeps grouping separated from fetching/rendering).
